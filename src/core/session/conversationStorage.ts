 *
 * Write strategy:
 *   - messages.jsonl is a fully append-only ledger (plan stage 3): a revision
 *     is a second line carrying the same id, and removal is a `msg.truncate`
 *     event line (messageLedger.ts) rather than a rewrite. `foldMessageLog`
 *     keeps the last put per id and applies truncate/tomb events strictly in
 *     the order they were written. Nothing rewrites an existing line anymore
 *     except `appendToFile`'s fallback (read+rewrite only when the native
 *     O(1) append command itself is unavailable).
 *   - WriteQueue batches writes per file (100ms debounce) and collapses queued
 *     revisions of the same message into one line; event rows (truncates)
 *     are order-sensitive and never merge across a put
 *   - UUID-based dedup prevents duplicate writes on restart
 *   - Streaming tokens stay in memory; only complete messages hit disk
 *   - The 5s crash-protection flush and per-tool-result writes go to
 *     stream-snapshot.json, NOT the ledger — see the stream snapshot section
 *     for why that budget matters

 * RB-03 fix: drop any stream-snapshot entry the ledger has already made

 * against (`entry.stamp` — see `snapshotMessageRevision`), the ledger either
 * (a) contains a newer `msg.put` for the SAME id (a durable checkpoint landed
 * and this process just never got to delete the now-superseded snapshot
 * file), or (b) was cut by a truncate/tomb/loopDrop event whose fold-time
 * effect removed that id (a stale snapshot must not revive a message the
 * user already deleted). An entry with no stamp (`undefined` — a legacy
 * on-disk file predating this fix) keeps the previous unconditional-merge
 * behavior, same as an entry the ledger has genuinely not touched since it
 * was captured (the crash-protection purpose this buffer exists for).
 *
 * `raw.length < entry.stamp` is a defensive third case: an append-only
 * ledger's length only grows, so a *current* length shorter than what this
 * entry was stamped against means something OUTSIDE this fold rewrote
 * `messages.jsonl` since capture (e.g. a downgrade-then-reupgrade across a
 * pre-ledger build, the scenario `feat/snapshot-watermark` guards at the
 * whole-file level) — per-entry, a stamp that outreaches the current ledger
 * is definitionally stale too, regardless of whether either offset check
 * above fires.
 *
 * Best-effort: when anything is dropped, the filtered set is written back to
 * disk (and the in-memory buffer re-armed from it — see `loadMessages`) so
 * the stale entry does not resurface on a future load if this call's own
 * `writeStreamSnapshot` never lands; either way the guard re-evaluates fresh
 * on every load, so a delete failure just gets filtered again next time
 * (audit RB-03 close condition: delete-failure tolerance follows free).
