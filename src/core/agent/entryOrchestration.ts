/**
 * Shared entry-orchestration precompute — P1-3B-3A item 1.
 *
 * Extracted from `runAgentLoop`'s entry sequence (`agentLoop.ts`, originally
 * the block spanning the old `:772-832` — route → skill-content refresh →
 * entryModelDeclared/capability-prompt derivation → `buildSystemPromptSections`)
 * so the 3b-3B shell dispatch layer can precompute EXACTLY the same
 * `{route, systemPromptSections}` pair the in-process loop computes, from a
 * single source, instead of a second hand-copied implementation that could
 * drift. `AgentLoopOptions.orchestration` (added P1-3b-1) is the injection
 * seam both paths funnel through.
 *
 * ── Import-graph note (design doc §2 "雷 1") ────────────────────────────
 * This module imports from `./orchestrator` (`routeInput`/
 * `buildSystemPromptSections`), which drags the heaviest DRAGGER cluster in
 * the app (registry/mcpManager/settingsStore/defaultWorkspace stores/skill
 * loader — see the design doc's §2 "雷 1"). `agentLoop.ts` must NEVER take a
 * STATIC import of this module — that would re-drag the whole orchestrator
 * graph into the sidecar bundle that hosts `runAgentLoop`. Its only
 * reference is a DYNAMIC `await import('./entryOrchestration')` inside the
 * `options?.orchestration ?? ...` fallback branch in `runAgentLoop` itself,
 * which is provably dead code on the sidecar path — `agentLoopHost.ts`
 * ALWAYS supplies `options.orchestration`, precomputed shell-side by the
 * 3b-3B dispatcher using this SAME `precomputeOrchestration` function. The
 * sidecar build additionally carries a THROWING bundle-graph-only shim for
 * this module (`sidecar/src/shims/entryOrchestrationRun.ts`) so if that
 * fallback branch is EVER actually reached sidecar-side (a wiring bug), it
 * fails loudly instead of quietly pulling in the whole orchestrator graph or
 * silently running against wrong state.
 *
 * ── Reordering note (documented per the card's "keep every side effect in
 * exactly the same order... anything you cannot cleanly extract without
 * reordering: leave it in the loop" instruction) ─────────────────────────
 * `entryModelDeclared` is recomputed HERE (pure — `getEffectiveModel`/
 * `resolveAgentModel`/`resolveModelDeclared`, no side effects) purely to
 * derive the capability prompt's `supportsTools` flag for
 * `buildSystemPromptSections`. The LOOP recomputes an equivalent
 * `effectiveModelId`/`entryModelDeclared` pair AGAIN, right after this call,
 * to (a) call `setActiveModel` — a genuine side effect on `tokenEstimator`'s
 * module-global calibration state, which stays uniquely in the loop, never
 * duplicated here — and (b) derive `toolContext.supportsVision`. This is a
 * small (~6-line) DUPLICATE of a pure formula, not the drifting
 * orchestration-call duplicate the card warns against.
 *
 * The one true reordering this extraction causes: `setActiveModel`'s
 * assignment now happens AFTER `buildSystemPromptSections`'s `await`
 * resolves, instead of before (the original code computed
 * effectiveModelId/setActiveModel/entryModelDeclared BETWEEN the old
 * route-computation position and the old systemPromptSections-computation
 * position; merging both into one earlier atomic precompute call moves the
 * await earlier). Verified this is behaviorally inert for a single loop's
 * own execution: `orchestrator.ts` has ZERO reference to
 * `tokenEstimator`/`activeModel` (grepped — no hits), so
 * `buildSystemPromptSections` never reads the value `setActiveModel` sets.
 * The only theoretical effect is a few-microtasks-wider window during which
 * a DIFFERENT, concurrently-running conversation's own token-estimation call
 * could observe THIS conversation's not-yet-updated `activeModelId` on the
 * shared module global — a benign, PRE-EXISTING race (tokenEstimator
 * calibration is a soft heuristic, not correctness-critical; any two
 * concurrent `runAgentLoop` calls already race on this same global at their
 * own respective `setActiveModel` calls today, regardless of this
 * extraction) that is not newly introduced, only very slightly widened for
 * this one call site. No existing test depends on it — full suite verified
 * green after this change (see P1-3B-3A-REPORT.md).
