/**
 * App check — version + update status.
 *
 * Two independent facts are shown on one row:
 *  - The version NUMBER is always live: `APP_VERSION` is a compile-time
 *    constant baked from package.json (vite `__APP_VERSION__`), so it always
 *    reflects the running build. It is never read from the persisted
 *    diagnostic snapshot.
 *  - The up-to-date VERDICT is derived from an ACTIVE forced update check
 *    against the release feed (electron-updater `latest-mac.yml`), not from a
 *    passively-read cached flag. Diagnostic results are persisted
 *    (diagnosticStore), so a verdict computed from `updateInfo` alone would
 *    freeze at whatever it was the last time the panel ran — that is exactly
 *    the stale-snapshot bug where an updated app kept showing its old version
 *    and "已是最新". Forcing a real check here makes "已是最新" mean the feed
 *    was actually consulted just now, not merely "no update known this session".
