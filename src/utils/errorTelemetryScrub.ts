/**
 * What an automatic error report is allowed to carry off the machine.
 *
 * `reportError` is the single funnel for every automatic remote report — the
 * agent loop's api_error/agent_crash, the shell crash channel's
 * main/renderer crashes, and the sidecar crash-loop breaker all go through
 * it. Until now it forwarded `Error.message` with only four credential-shaped
 * patterns replaced, so anything else the message happened to carry left the
 * machine intact:
 *
 *     ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/alice/客户方案/plan.docx'
 *
 * Provider response bodies were already kept local (`rawBody` is hardcoded
 * `null`); this closes the same hole for the message itself.
 *
 * The approach is normalisation, not deletion. A category code alone would
 * make a brand-new failure unreadable ("something broke, 240 times"), so the
 * message keeps its diagnostic skeleton and loses every span that could
 * carry user content:
 *
 *     ENOENT: no such file or directory, open <str>
 *
 * That still says exactly what failed, groups cleanly, and names nothing.
 * The raw message is untouched locally — the runtime-observability log and
 * the user-initiated diagnostic bundle both still have it, which is where
 * root-causing actually happens.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, stated so nobody reads this as a guarantee it does not make:
 * normalisation removes spans that have a recognisable SHAPE — paths, URLs,
 * emails, CJK runs, quoted spans, credential formats. A bare unquoted latin
 * token cannot be told apart from ordinary error prose ("board-memo" and
 * "connection refused" are the same shape), so one can still ride along in a
 * message like `Unknown provider board-memo`. Closing that last gap means
 * dropping the message entirely and reporting `errorType` + `errorCode` +
 * `fingerprint` only. That remains a one-line change here — the fingerprint
 * is computed from the normalised text, so grouping survives it — and is a
 * product call about how readable the remote signal has to be, not a
 * technical blocker.
