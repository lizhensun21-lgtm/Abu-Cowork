 * Opt a card's own header row into the window drag lane — macOS only.
 *
 * Windows and Linux draw their own chrome row above the content cards with an
 * explicit drag lane (see `WindowTitleBar`; since the workspace-header rework
 * that is the single native title strip — the old second "toolbar" lane is
 * gone). macOS has no such
 * row: `titleBarStyle: 'hidden'` leaves the card starting 8px below the window
 * top, so the band beside the traffic lights *is* the card, and the card is
 * `data-electron-no-drag`. The result was that only the top 8px of the window
 * could ever move it.
 *
 * Marking a header row with `data-electron-drag` re-opens the lane there. The
 * stylesheet keeps every child of that row no-drag, so titles stay
 * double-clickable and buttons stay clickable without per-element marking.
 *
 * Spread it onto the row element: `<div {...windowDragRowProps()} className=…>`
