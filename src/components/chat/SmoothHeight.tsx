// Only height changes bigger than this animate. Streamed tokens grow content a

// *swaps*: the work-process fold replacing an expanded thinking/step block at
// completion (-100~200px), or the user toggling that fold open.

// Matches claude.ai's collapsible-block transition duration (280ms ease-out),

/**
 * Smooths abrupt height changes of its children: when the content's natural
 * height jumps by more than THRESHOLD_PX in one layout pass, the wrapper pins
 * its height and transitions to the new value instead of letting it land in a
 * single frame.
 *
 * Why this exists: with the chat pinned to the bottom, a one-frame shrink of
 * the last message group (the completion fold replacing the expanded thinking
 * block) clamps scrollTop instantly — the whole view visibly jumps DOWN. The
 * mount direction is covered by .block-expand-enter, but the fold is a
 * component *swap* (TaskBlock unmounts, the "已处理 Xs" header mounts), so no
 * CSS enter/exit animation on either component can bridge it. Animating the
 * measured height of the region that contains the swap can.
 *
 * Non-goals / guarantees:
 * - First measure after mount never animates — history rows remounting during
 *   virtualized scrolling must not dance.
 * - Small (≤ threshold) changes are untouched: height stays `auto`, streaming
 *   text follows instantly.
 * - Honors prefers-reduced-motion; no-ops entirely without ResizeObserver
 *   (jsdom).
