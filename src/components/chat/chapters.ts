/**
 * Chapters for the conversation rail — the left-hand tick scale that lets the
 * user jump back to an earlier stretch of a long conversation.
 *
 * Chapters are DERIVED, never stored: one chapter per user turn, read straight
 * off the groups `groupMessagesByLoop` already produces. That choice is load
 * bearing, not an implementation shortcut:
 *
 *   - every existing conversation gets a usable rail with no migration, and
 *   - the rail can never be empty, which a model-driven scheme cannot promise.
 *
 * Claude Code marks chapters purely by having the model call a `mark_chapter`
 * tool, and its main-process handler has no side effect at all — the UI reads
 * the tool call back out of the transcript. Reverse-engineering that build
 * showed the weakness of the design: a session spanning dozens of turns
 * carried two chapters, because the model simply does not call the tool often
 * enough. A later batch adds the same tool here, but only to *rename* a
 * derived chapter and attach a summary — the skeleton stays derived.
 *
 * Titles and summaries therefore always have a fallback: the user's own words
 * for the title, the assistant's first reply for the summary.

 * sits beneath it, and at the end of a conversation there never is, so a purely
