 * Pure, testable helpers for AddProviderModal's model checklist. Kept
 * dependency-free (no React, no store) so they can be unit tested directly;
 * `isKnown` is injected rather than imported so callers can stub it in tests
 * without touching the real capability table.
 *
 * Background: a raw GET /v1/models call against an aggregator/gateway
 * endpoint can return hundreds of unrelated chat models. Pre-checking them
 * (whether all of them, or just the ids the local capability table happens to
 * recognize) means the user has to audit and uncheck a list they never chose.
 * The rule is now "fetch shows, the user picks": a cloud fetch never changes
 * the selection — it only populates the list, ordered known-first so the
 * familiar ids are the ones in reach, with a search box to narrow it down.
 * Locally pulled catalogs (Ollama) are the exception — see `unionSelectAll`.
