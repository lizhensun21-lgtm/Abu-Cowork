/**
 * Sidecar-local replacement for `src/core/agent/ports/authorizedPathsReader.ts`.
 *
 * Real forwarding shim (same class as `conversationStorageRun.ts`'s
 * `replaceMessageById`, NOT a throwing bundle-graph-only stub): the
 * shell's `authorizedWorkspaces` map (`src/core/tools/pathSafety.ts`) is
 * populated by `authorizeWorkspace()` calls that only happen shell-side
 * (`registry.ts:407`, `triggerPermission.ts`) — the sidecar process has no
 * such state of its own, so `run_command`'s sandboxed writes need a live
 * reverse RPC to see the SAME authorized-paths set the shell would use, not
 * an always-empty local stand-in (which would under-authorize the OS-level
 * sandbox for every sidecar-run `run_command` call).
 *
 * Sends the `workspace.authorizedWritablePaths` REQUEST (shell handler:
 * `agentLoopRunner.ts`'s `handleWorkspaceAuthorizedPaths`, which returns the
 * REAL `getAuthorizedWritablePaths()` — same function
 * `createInProcessAuthorizedPathsReader` wraps in the shell/in-process case)
 * and returns its `string[]` result. No params needed — the authorized-paths
 * map is shell-global, not per-run.
